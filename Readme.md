Install
-------
Disable SELINUX. See distro docs.

Fork that git repo to your namespace and clone it to your favorite location
```
git clone https://code.getnoc.com/noc/noc-dc.git /opt/noc-dc

cd /opt/noc-dc
```
Run *pre.sh* script for make dirs\permissions\config
```
./pre.sh -p all
```
If you need change default install path to other or
 other image run `pre.sh` with parameter `-d` or `-t`
```bash
./pre.sh -p all -d /opt/noc-dc -t stable
```
All tags for -t parameter:
https://code.getnoc.com/noc/noc/container_registry

Check `./data/noc/etc/noc.conf` and edit config if needed

Install *docker-compose*:

see URL: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Check "docker" daemon is running

Preparing to launch containers:
```
export DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=200
docker-compose up --no-start
```

Run initial db init and migrations
```
docker-compose up migrate
```
Wait for process to finish and than run noc itself

Be aware that command will run lots of noc daemons and intended
to be pretty slow.  
On my laptops it took at about 2 minutes to get everything started

If you have IDE HDD or notebook use `slowstart.sh`. see `Readme.faq.md`
```shell script
./slowstart.sh
```

If you have SSD blockdevice: 
```
docker-compose up -d 
```

Go to https://0.0.0.0 default credentials

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

# Limitations

* Only single node. No way to scale noc daemons to multihost.
* Databases outside container in `./data/...` . 
* Only single pool "default". No way to add equipment from different vrfs.
* need 10G+ free space on block device
* SSD block device highly recommended. Start more that 2 minutes.

Install monitoring
-------

Read `data/vmagent/etc/Readme.md` and setup export metrics from docker host

Run compose file `docker-compose-infra.yml`
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d
```
Open URL:
*  Grafana: http://0.0.0.0:3000
*  Sentry: https://0.0.0.0:9000
